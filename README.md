# Game_Memory-Cards:

This project was interesting to do because not only I coded the logics behind selecting cards
but as well I added multiple other functionalities which gave the user the opportunity to 
manipulate:
-size of the grid
-time limit 
-speed of the cards
which occasionaly gave me some other problems that were dealing with interactivity between 
different states of the game.
